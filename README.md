# Nación Libertad

## Createbase Community Hackathon

## Metagov Bounty Proposal

Living standard in third world countries has resulted in a massive loss of talent (brain drain) to countries able to guarantee better rule of law, security and democracy.

Nación Libertad is a “brain gain” community that support the transfer of know-how back to migrants’ home countries to improve their public good.

Since authoritarian regimes riddled with corruption, bigotry and censorship of dissent typically rule third world countries we have chose Web3 as a mean to secure the access of their citizens to the information produced and conveyed by our community members.

Also we have chose Web3 to allow anybody build their interface to the data stored at NEAR. We believe that by promoting protocol over platform, collaborative action and open participation will increase [Protocols, not platforms: A Technological approach to free speech](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)

Our main goals are:

- Help local communities to organize and expose their needs and constraints to Nación Libertad innovators
- Empower citizens to self-organize towards the solution of their needs
- Increase awareness about the importance of collective action
  Community members can select three different roles: advocates, innovators or organizers. [Should you agitate, innovate or orchestrate](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/should_you_agitate_innovate_or_orchestrate)

### Action Plan

Prelaunch:

1. Training campaign to explain Nación Libertad’s goal, its benefits
2. Onboarding campaign in which we will explain and help them create their NEAR wallet. We will create a series of videos for this that will be distributed through our social media.

### Trainings

#### Brief Drafting for advocates

For local communities we will create a video tutorial in which we will provide a standard process to gather their needs, to clearly explain them to the rest of community members, raise awareness and promote engagement.

#### Design Thinking for innovators

We will train innovators to adopt design thinking mindset and tools to empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test and implement solutions to local communities’ needs. We will use “The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design” by IDEO as reference.

#### Agile Training for orchestrators

We will train organizers in agile methodology, both Scrum and Kanban adapted to collaborative action usage.

#### Launch Event:

- Online gathering in which local communities will share their needs to the community. We will provide them a presentation template to ensure consistency in the information shared with the rest of members of community
- Solution presentation to the local community
- Proposal items will be voted using the quaker consensus decision-making process
- Once approved, local community will implement with the support of organizers
- Every milestone will be shared with the all community

To organize communities we will promote the use of DAOs on the NEAR protocol, with a Quaker-based decision-making process instead of the current one (majority). Our goal is to create the contract that will rule these DAOs.
I have experience developing Solidity and Hyperledger smart contracts and currently I am on the NEAR developer certification. I have also developed training in several matters such as UX Research, Design Thinking, Blockchain and Innovation.

Since Nación Libertad is a global community, English and Spanish will be our two main languages, increasing the exposure of NEAR protocol to the Spanish Speaking world ([442 million people ](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/spanish-speaking-countries))
